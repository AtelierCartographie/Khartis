# What's new in Khartis v2.0

-   **global redesign** for a better experience and ergonomy
-   **new projection available : Bertin 1953**. Thanks to Philippe Rivière (@Fil). More information on [Visionscarto.net](https://visionscarto.net/bertin-projection-1953)
-   **new viz “categories > ordered symbols”**: to show a hierarchy on points (capitals of state, chief towns of regions, communes ... or a ranking in a typology). This viz is based on Jacques Bertin’s work.
-   **new viz “categories > ordered surface”**: to show a hierarchy (ranking) on surface. Reverse order of ranking is possible. 
-   **new discretization available “manual thresholds”**: if you’re not satisfied with automatic discretization make your own one.
-   new option to check your data on the fly: a **tooltip** is available on the map
-   **auto-update** on offline app: don’t miss new version
-   **improve rendering of pattern** with a new scale option
-   **more projects saved in the browser** and we add a new way to reopen your project saved locally: by dragging and dropping it.
-   **filter basemap list** to quickly find the one you need
-   a lot of improvement in reactivity and performance : in the data step and with the zoom
-   bug fix: SVG export now support opacity
